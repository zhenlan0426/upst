"""Pytest configuration shared across all test modules.

We *explicitly* add the project root directory (one level up from the *tests*
package) to ``sys.path`` so that ``import upst`` works even when the working
directory inside the test runner is not the project root.

This approach keeps the repository lightweight â€“ we do not need to create a
full setuptools/pyproject installation just to make tests importable.
