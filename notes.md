# overall objective
I am an investor of the stock upstart. I would like to track their open positions to gain insights into the company. https://careers.upstart.com/jobs/search. I would like to run code periodically to track trends over time.

# metrics to track
1. High-Level Hiring:
    - Total Open Positions
    - Newly Opened Positions: How many new roles were added since the last check
    - Recently Closed Positions: How many roles were removed?
    - Average Lifespan of a Job Posting
2. Strategic Focus & Departmental Allocation:
    - Distribution of Openings by Department
3. Talent Seniority:
    - distribution of seniority Level, e.g. associate, senior, Manager, Director, VP, etc.
    - Salary Range Analysis: for range of a given position, use the average of the range as the salary for that position.
        - summarize the median salary for different seniority levels.
        - summarize the median salary for different departments.
        - summarize the sum of all salaries for all positions.
4. Keyword Analysis of Job Titles & Descriptions. Note that keywords analysis should not be limited to pre-defined list of keywords but re-run the analysis each time we pull the data to get the most up-to-date keywords and company trends:
    - Strategic Initiatives: "AI," "Machine Learning," "Auto Lending," "Mortgage," "Partnerships," "Marketplace." This gives you direct insight into their product roadmap and strategic bets.
    - Technology Stack: Specific programming languages (e.g., Python, Java), cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP), or data tools. This can show where they are investing technologically.
